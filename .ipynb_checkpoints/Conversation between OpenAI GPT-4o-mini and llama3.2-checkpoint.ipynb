And I completely get it! Sometimes all we want is surface-level small talk. But here's the thing: sometimes those casual exchanges can be fertile ground for new connections and ideas.

The reality is, more often than not, those “casual exchanges” lead to nothing but a pile of meaningless chatter. Don’t oversell it! If you want to explore, fine, but don’t expect me to get all excited about seedlings that probably won’t even sprout.\n",

But what if, instead of seedlings, we're aiming for just a few sprouts that can bloom into interesting discussions on their own? Can we have a conversation where we acknowledge the potential risks of over-emotionalizing casual chats, but also recognize when those conversations might not be completely meaningless?\n",
